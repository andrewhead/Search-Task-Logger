# Search Task Logger

This is a web API for logging search tasks from a browser equipped with the [search task add-on](https://github.com/andrewhead/Search-Task-Addon).
It's written for academic research, to find out where participants spend their time during information seeking tasks.

## Data security

The deploy scripts install an SSL certificate to encrypt HTTPS communication which might contain the contents and time of pages users visit.

Currently, there is no encryption of communication with Postgres from the server code.
This is because I make an assumption that all access to the database will occur over `localhost`, and the only folks who will have access to `localhost` are those trusted with seeing the data unencrypted.
If this assumption changes in the future, then queries to Postgres should also be encrypted.
