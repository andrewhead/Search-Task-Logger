    <i>Reminder:</i> Use the web to answer these two questions:
    <span class='li'>Which package has a <b>better community</b> for clients of the package?</span>
    <span class='li'>Which package has <b>better documentation</b>?</span>
    <br/>
    The two packages you are comparing are {{ package1 }} and {{ package2 }}.
    Start with {{ package1 }}, and the researcher will let you know when to move on to {{ package2 }}.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you feel you have found all the information you want to find for a package, let the researcher know and you can move on.
